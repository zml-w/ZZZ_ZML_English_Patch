# üíï Brief Introduction to the Nodes:
**This is a feature-rich COMFYUI custom node pack, mainly related to ‚ÄúImage, Text, Integer, LoRA Loader, Mask‚Äù, along with some miscellaneous small tools. Currently, there are 70+ nodes in total.**

`I developed these according to my own needs.`

`Some nodes have a ‚Äúhelp‚Äù output interface, which contains detailed introductions of the nodes. If a node does not have help and you don‚Äôt know how to use it, you can check the previous version update notes.`

`All node names start with ‚ÄúZML_‚Äù and are all placed under the ‚ÄúImage/ZML_Image‚Äù category.`

> ### Initially designed for easy management of images and prompts, saving prompts as PNG text chunks within the images:
> <img width="1632" height="875" alt="1_1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b23e248e-dc40-4000-9cb7-0f77dd448350" />
>
> ### For even more convenient management, I also created a visual UI:
> <img width="1739" height="877" alt="1_15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14957496-ca5e-406d-8c07-e944371c98f3" />
>
> ### Text chunks can be edited in real-time:

>
> ### And then output:

>
> ### The "Load Image from Path" node can randomize images and text chunks. The "Load Image" node can output an alpha channel and text chunks; no images are provided for these.

> ### Next are other image nodes, such as visual image cropping:
> <img width="982" height="893" alt="1_2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bbf3bb4-9c4e-4d9a-bf0b-6a415d0eea7b" />

> ### Due to the large number of features, I won't go into detail. The images should give you a general idea.
>
> ### However, there's one feature I really want to tell you about! The nodes can be used with Nunchuck!! Use the functions of the powerful LoRA node to manage your LoRAs, then connect the loaded LoRA list to the dedicated loading node I made for Nunchuck, and you can use Nunchuck with the powerful features of the LoRA Loader!!

## ‚ú® Version Update Notes

> ### Latest Update Date: **2025.09.21**
>

> - #### Fixed a bug where the brush display in the Drawing node was abnormal after zooming, and added a default image for the Drawing node.
>
> - #### The UI for preset text in the Text Selection V3 node now supports storing text in folders.
>
> - #### The Text to Format node now includes a "Comma Append Newline" option.
>
> - #### Added a new "Color to Mask" node.

<details>

> ### Update Date: **2025.09.18**
>

> - #### Added a "Merge Same Prompts" node, which can combine identical prompts into one.
>
> - #### Added an "Append Prompt" node. After detecting keywords, you can choose to Append/Replace a pre-set prompt, or perform a full replacement.
>
> - #### Removed the Text Block Loader node.
>
> - #### Fully optimized the Tagged Image Selection node. It now offers two sorting modes (descending or ascending by name) and has added buttons for quickly reaching the top or bottom. The functionality of the Text Block Loader node has been merged into the Tagged Image node.
>
> - #### Fixed a bug in the Drawing node.
>
> - #### The Powerful LoRA Loader node now supports searching for LoRA names.
>
> - #### Optimized the functionality of the Text Selection V3 node.
>
> - #### Optimized the user experience of the Visual Color Adjustment node.
>
> - #### Optimized the functionality of the Preset Resolution node.

> ### Update Date: **2025.09.13**
>

> - #### Added Integer-String Conversion nodes.
>
> - #### Added a Transition Animation node, to generate animations transitioning from image A to image B.
>
> - #### Fully optimized the Tagged Image Selection node. It can now randomly select images and includes a new "Medium Icon" mode, making it easier to observe image differences. It can also output folder paths to the "Load Image from Path" node for parallel random selection. When the "Remember Open Location" button is enabled, it outputs the path of the open location; when disabled, it outputs the address bar path.
>
> - #### The UI for the Text Block Extractor node has been removed and now reuses the UI of the Tagged Image Selection node. Unlike the Tagged Image Selection node, it doesn't display path indexes, but directly extracts and displays text blocks within the node frame. This allows for modifications to prompts without altering the text blocks within the image.
>
> - #### Added a Visual Color Adjustment node, supporting various parameters such as "Brightness, Contrast, Noise, Vignette..." and many more not listed individually.
>
> - #### Various other minor optimizations will not be detailed at this time.


> ### Update Date: **2025.09.10**
>
> #### This is a significant update.

> - #### Added a new Multi-Text Input_Five V2 node, for use with text images.
>
> - #### Changed the dependency file paths for Merge, Crop, and Draw nodes to dynamic loading. This resolves issues where nodes became unusable due to filenames ending with "main".
>
> - #### Added a new Cylindrical Projection node.
>
> - #### Added a new Panorama Preview node, for VR previewing your images. Can be used with a Kontexet LoRA. Currently still in testing; released early because someone just reported a bug in the previous version, and I didn't want to meticulously troubleshoot it, so I released my current working version directly.
>
> - #### The LoRA name list output type for the Powerful LoRA Loader node has been changed to a string, meaning it can now be saved into a text block! Save all LoRA and artist strings within a single image, then simply load that image when you want to use them. This method also prevents your artist strings and LoRAs from being displayed in the workflow, so even if you send the original image, your art style won't be revealed! To support this feature, I've also added a Text Classification node, allowing you to set specific delimiters to separate LoRAs and prompts in the text block, and then use the Text Split node to break them apart. An example workflow has been uploaded!
>
> - #### Major update to the Text Image node! Now supports image input. When an image is input, the node will automatically stitch the text image onto the input image, useful for adding annotations and creating comparison images. Supports batch loading of images! When loading multiple batches of images, it will automatically sort them and calculate font size and text image resolution. If you want to specify the starting sort number, step, prefix, and suffix, simply use the syntax "#x:x#", where x is a number. For example, entering "ZML_#0:0.5#W" will result in the first image's sequence number being "ZML_0_W", the second "ZML_0.5_W", and so on! To complement this node, I've also optimized the Unified Resolution node for easier combined use!

> ### Updated: **2025.09.06**
>
> - #### Optimized the UI of the powerful LoRA Loader node, making it more comfortable to use! Multiple color theme options have also been added!
>
> - #### Optimized all text nodes! They now all support line breaks! And I've changed the default delimiter to ",\n\n" for all of them, making the prompt structure much clearer and more visible!
>
> - #### The Text Selector V3 node now includes a preset text button, allowing you to add presets to the text box with a single click!
>
> - #### Added a new "Load LoRA by Name (nunchaku)" node. Yes, it's adapted for nunchaku, allowing for more convenient use of nunchaku by combining the "Powerful LoRA Loader" node with "Load LoRA by Name (nunchaku)"!
>

> ### Update Date: **2025.09.04**

> - #### The Tagged Image Selection Node can now remember the last opened location, so you no longer have to search for subfolders every time you open it.
>
> - #### Removed the regular LORA loading node.
>
> - #### When parsing LORA metadata and fetching C-site information for powerful LORAs, if a "wan" LORA is encountered, both the MP4 and the initial frame will now be saved simultaneously.
> 
> - #### The powerful LORA Loader node, and the batch add LORA page, now support MP4 playback!!
>
> - #### There are also some minor optimizations, which won't be detailed here.

> ### Update Date: **2025.09.03**
>
> - #### Fixed a minor bug in the Random Text Weight node.
>
> - #### Fixed a bug where the Save Image node could not preview images.
>
> - #### Added diagonal mask support to the Mask Split node.
> 
> - #### Removed the GIF File Path node and added a Load Video from Path node, which also supports loading GIFs.
>
> - #### Optimized the Text Format Conversion node. Now, in addition to converting NAI weights to SD, it also supports clearing all weights in one click (both NAI and SD). It also supports appending spaces after commas in prompts. Removed help text (punctuation normalization replaces non-standard commas, periods, and the ‚ÄúBREAK‚Äù syntax with SDXL-compatible syntax).
>
> - #### Added the Limit Image Ratio node, which can pad or crop images to a specified ratio. Later, you can use the Limit Solid Background node to remove the padding background.
>
> - #### Optimized the Powerful LoRA Loader node, mainly its UI for batch loading LoRAs.
>
>   * In addition to square previews, it now supports vertical and horizontal previews.
>   * You can view and edit txt and log files (trigger words and descriptions) in real-time, and also delete LoRAs and related files with one click. Deleted LoRAs will be labeled ‚ÄúDeleted‚Äù to prevent incorrect loading.
